Notice that there are some changes to the code since the first lecture :)
Specifically, we've added links in the index view so a user can look at any given sushi's show page.

Also notice a few minor additions:
- added a layout file that will always load when erb is called, then the template that's called will be inserted at the `<%= yield %>` 
- added some links in the views (we never expect user to type in the url bar)
- added some really minor, really bad inline styling :)
- added a small bit of absurdity ;)
